## Problem Statement
Over the last decade, the introduction of digital ticketing has become a significant trend. Attendees can now buy tickets on their smartphones, save a copy of their ticket to their device pocket, and use it to gain access to the venue directly. Ticket sellers then communicate with their customers on a more intimate level and start cultivating long-term relationships. It has become a more convenient and beneficial method of ticketing. However, blockchain solutions can impact ticketing solutions and help the industry evolve in a more effective way.

While digital ticketing (to some extent) eliminates paper inefficiencies such as fraud and convenience, there are still some digital stumbling blocks to overcome.
1. Unscrupulous resellers take screenshots or photocopies of tickets and resell them to unsuspecting victims several times.
2. Organizers lack power and access to secondary markets, which allows for inflated ticket resale.
3. Due to unregulated secondary markets, bad actors still gain access to events. Additionally, personal data is always at risk on centralized ticketing systems, which are vulnerable to attacks.
4. These challenges create opportunities for blockchain to make an innovative impact on ticketing solutions for those who value protection and accountability.

## Blockchain Event Ticketing
A **blockchain-based event ticketing system** is a revolutionary approach to managing and distributing tickets for events. It leverages the power of blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and efficient ticketing process.
This system uses **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** to represent each ticket. NFTs are unique digital assets stored on the blockchainÂ². Each ticket is unique, can't be reproduced, and has its own identity. This ensures that once a ticket is sold, its record is immutable, meaning it cannot be duplicated or altered.

The system addresses several significant challenges in the ticketing industry:
1. **Fake tickets**: Blockchain ticketing can prevent fake tickets as each ticket going through the blockchain receives its own identity.
2. **Scalpers and bots**: It can help block bots and define rules around which tickets can be resold.
3. **Security**: It allows organizers to identify their patrons precisely, even if a ticket has been exchanged just before entering.
4. **Data**: It provides a more transparent and customer-friendly experience.
